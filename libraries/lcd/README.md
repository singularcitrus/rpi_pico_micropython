# LCD API

This library consists of [`lcd_api.py`](https://github.com/T-622/RPI-PICO-I2C-LCD/blob/25cec0dd31b884b4141a6e649d45befae612706f/lcd_api.py) 
and [`pico_i2c_lcd.py`](https://github.com/T-622/RPI-PICO-I2C-LCD/blob/25cec0dd31b884b4141a6e649d45befae612706f/pico_i2c_lcd.py)
from https://github.com/T-622/RPI-PICO-I2C-LCD

I condensed it into one file and stripped out anything that I didn't need to make the library as small as possible
